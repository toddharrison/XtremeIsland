XtremeIsland
============

XtremeIsland is a single player game where you are transported to an empty world where all you have
is a tiny island and a meager set of supplies to survive. Challenges may be completed for additional
resources and your overall score is tracked realtime against other players. You get one chance to
expand your island score as high as possible before falling prey to clumsiness or the dangers of a
ruthless world. The difficulty is hard and natural health recovery is disabled. If you die, it's all
over. Your island is removed and your score reset.

XtremeIsland is built against the latest 1.2.1-SNAPSHOT of [canarymod](http://www.canarymod.net/)
and supports Minecraft 1.8.
